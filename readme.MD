# Decentralized Application
This is a repository built while writing an article on my blog on Medium.  

The article for this branch can be found [here](https://itnext.io/creating-a-inheritable-staking-contract-in-solidity-7804ae2d7a32)  
The repository showcases how a DApp can look like.  

In the Repository you will find a custom built BEP-20 Smart contract that has  
staking and rewarding mechanisms in place.
